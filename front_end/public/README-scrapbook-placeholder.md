# Default Scrapbook Placeholder Image

## Instructions for Adding the Default Placeholder Image

To complete the scrapbook feature, you need to add the heartwarming athlete-child image as a default placeholder.

### Image Details:
- **File name**: `default-scrapbook-placeholder.jpg`
- **Location**: `front_end/public/default-scrapbook-placeholder.jpg`
- **Description**: A heartwarming image of an adult male athlete (wearing jersey #32) and a young boy both smiling and posing together in what appears to be an indoor sports facility

### Image Specifications:
- **Format**: JPG
- **Recommended size**: 400x300 pixels (or similar aspect ratio)
- **Content**: 
  - Adult athlete with dark skin, braided hair, wearing grey basketball jersey with #32
  - Young boy with light skin, short light-brown hair, wearing bright yellow basketball jersey
  - Both smiling broadly and posing together
  - Indoor sports facility background (basketball court/gymnasium)
  - Bright, even lighting typical of indoor sports events

### Purpose:
This image serves as a fallback placeholder when scrapbook images fail to load, representing the core mission of Team IMPACT - connecting athletes with children to inspire, empower, and build lasting friendships.

### Usage:
The image will automatically be used when:
- A scrapbook image fails to load due to network issues
- An uploaded image is corrupted or inaccessible
- The Supabase storage URL is invalid

### Implementation:
The image is already integrated into the ScrapbookPage component and will be used automatically once the file is placed in the correct location.
