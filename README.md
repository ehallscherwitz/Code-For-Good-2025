# Team IMPACT - Empowering all kids and teams to bond, grow, and win ‚Äî together.

## Overview

Team IMPACT is a comprehensive web application designed to connect children with serious illnesses and disabilities with college athletes, creating meaningful relationships and lasting friendships. The platform serves as a digital hub for managing the entire Team IMPACT ecosystem, from initial family registration to event coordination and memory sharing.

## Where we Fit

Team IMPACT has an established working model that successfully connects children with serious illnesses and disabilities to college athletic teams, creating meaningful relationships and lasting friendships. However, the organization faces several operational challenges that impact their ability to scale and maintain engagement:

### Current Pain Points

**Manual Matching Process**: The organization currently relies on manual processes to match each child with appropriate college athletes and teams. Whlie this works, this time-intensive approach requires staff resources and this time could be reallocated elsewhere and also lead to suboptimal matches based on limited information processing capacity 

**Inactivity and Retention Issues**: Maintaining long-term engagement between families and athletes proves challenging, with many relationships losing momentum over time. The lack of interactive features and ongoing connection opportunities leads to decreased participation and retention rates.

**Communication Limitations**: A major operational challenge is Team IMPACT's heavy reliance on email communication for coordinating between families, athletes, and staff. This creates bottlenecks in information flow, delayed responses, and fragmented communication threads that can impact the quality and timeliness of support. While we attempted to implement a Twilio API-based messaging system to address this issue, the verification process required several days and could not be completed within our development timeline. However, this represents a critical future enhancement that would significantly improve real-time communication and coordination across the platform.

### Our Solution

**AI-Powered Matching**: We leverage Google Gemini AI to automate and optimize the matching process. The system analyzes comprehensive family data, child preferences, medical conditions, location, and sport interests to provide intelligent recommendations for the best school and team matches. This eliminates manual guesswork and ensures more compatible, successful pairings.

**Interactive Engagement Features**: To address retention challenges, we've implemented dynamic features including:
- **Digital Scrapbook**: A photo-sharing platform where families and athletes can upload and organize memories, creating a lasting digital record of their journey together
- **Picture Carousels**: Interactive dashboards that showcase recent activities, achievements, and shared moments, keeping the community engaged and connected
- **Event Management**: Streamlined event creation and participation tracking to maintain regular interaction opportunities
- **Alumni Network**: Long-term relationship maintenance that extends beyond graduation

These innovations transform Team IMPACT from a manual, resource-intensive operation into an efficient, scalable platform that maximizes successful matches while maintaining high engagement levels throughout the entire relationship lifecycle.
